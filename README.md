GOduino III Robot Controller

BACKGROUND

The GOduino III is an Arduino compatible Open Source Hardware robot controller. A while ago, I set out to design a simple robot controller that I can use for both my microcontroller and robotics workshops as well as for my personal tech projects. 

The GOduino III is an Arduino clone. It's built with DIP ICs and through-hole components for ease of assembly and repair.  Also, The GOduino III can be inserted onto a breadboard making it possible to use jumper wires to connect sensors and other parts. The robot controller can handle 2 small servos and 2 DC brushed motors (max 1.2A for each motor).
